Most of the files required have either been downloaded using scripts 1-5 here, or included in the repository.

Particularly, the indexes are included here (datasets/indexes/)
However this is how to download and process those yourself if you want.

Devries and Webber SIMPLE TRIM: 
Download https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/models-and-data-products/ to datasets/exports

The only files left (well, they are actually required in Script 2) to download is the TPCA and chlor_a chlorophyll available from 
https://researchdata.ands.org.au/tropical-pacific-chlorophyll-reprocessing-v10/1438905
These should be placed in datasets/tpca/seawifs and datasets/tpca/modis
If on Gadi, can be accessed like:  cp  /g/data/ua8/ocean_color/TPCA_reprocessing/SeaWiFS/*nc tpca/

Chl is downloaded from: https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/Mapped/Daily/9km/chlor_a/
Many different ways to download this, 

NASA chlora is also needed. Maybe not necessary to run these sections (Bottom of part 2), because the mooring timeseries are provided in datasets/npp_mooring_timeseries  (See the shell script at the bottome for how to download NASA data)


Indexes
SOI: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/SOI/
MEI: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/
PDO: http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest

SOI:
curl https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/soi.long.data --output soi.csv
then open in notepad and replace '  ' (two spaces) with a comma, so it is a csv. A slightly modified version is provided here.

MEIv2:
curl https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/data/meiv2.data --output meiv2.csv
Open in notepad and replace '     ' (four spaces) with a comma so it is a csv.

PDO:
curl http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest --output pdo.csv
Reprocess as above. A copy is provided here though.

EMI
curl http://www.jamstec.go.jp/frsgc/research/d1/iod/DATA/emi.monthly.txt --output emi.csv
And process dates. A file of this is included albeit not used.

Mooring Physics:
https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/drupal/disdel/
These were obtained by selecting every variable for single location timeseries. These files are included here by default in datasets/tao/physics. These can be downloaded yourself if you want.


pCo2/Flux Products:
If you haven't already got these working. Here is some more information.

/yasanaka was obtained from Yasanaka. Ask her I cannot provide this. However, all references to this in the scripts have been commented out, so its not actually required.

/co2_gridded_landschuzer (as previously explained)
curl https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0105/0160558/4.4/data/0-data/MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018/spco2_MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018.nc --output spco2_MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018.nc
curl https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/ncei/ocads/data/0160558/MPI_SOM-FFN_v2020/spco2_MPI-SOM_FFN_v2020.nc --output spco2_MPI-SOM_FFN_v2020.nc

Main: https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/oceans/SPCO2_1982_present_ETH_SOM_FFN.html
New Version - Unused (with bgc argo data): https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:0191304

Xarray cannot open some of these files due to:

MissingDimensionsError: 'date' has more than 1-dimension and the same name as one of its dimensions ('time', 'date'). xarray disallows such variables because they conflict with the coordinates used to label dimensions.

Use NCO to convert this variable name so they can be opened. Ie. 
ncrename -v date,t MPI-SOM_FFN_SOCCOMv2018.nc
