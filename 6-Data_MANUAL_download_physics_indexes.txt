Most of the files required have either been downloaded using scripts 1-5 here, or included in the repository.

Particularly, the indexes are included here (datasets/indexes/)
However this is how to download and process those yourself if you want.



Indexes
SOI: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/SOI/
MEI: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/
PDO: http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest

SOI:
curl https://psl.noaa.gov/gcos_wgsp/Timeseries/Data/soi.long.data --output soi.csv
then open in notepad and replace '  ' (two spaces) with a comma, so it is a csv. A slightly modified version is provided here.

MEIv2:
curl https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/data/meiv2.data --output meiv2.csv
Open in notepad and replace '     ' (four spaces) with a comma so it is a csv.

PDO:
curl http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest --output pdo.csv
Reprocess as above. A copy is provided here though.



Mooring Physics:

These were obtained by selecting every variable for single location timeseries. These files are included here by default in datasets/tao/physics. These can be downloaded yourself if you want.



pCo2/Flux Products:
If you haven't already got these working. Here is some more information.

/yasanaka was obtained from Yasanaka. Ask her I cannot provide this. However, all references to this in the scripts have been commented out, so its not actually required.

/co2_gridded_landschuzer (as previously explained)
curl https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0105/0160558/4.4/data/0-data/MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018/spco2_MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018.nc --output spco2_MPI_SOM-FFN_v2018.nc
curl https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/ncei/ocads/data/0160558/MPI_SOM-FFN_v2020/spco2_MPI-SOM_FFN_v2020.nc --output spco2_MPI-SOM_FFN_v2020.nc

Xarray cannot open some of these files due to:

MissingDimensionsError: 'date' has more than 1-dimension and the same name as one of its dimensions ('time', 'date'). xarray disallows such variables because they conflict with the coordinates used to label dimensions.

Use NCO to convert this variable name so they can be opened. Ie. 
ncrename -v date,t MPI-SOM_FFN_SOCCOMv2018.nc
