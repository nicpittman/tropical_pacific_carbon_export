Hopefully most of the small files will be available in the repository.

If not you will now need to manually download physics and index data from:

save into: datasets/indexes/

Mooring Physics:
https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/drupal/disdel/
These were obtained by selecting every variable for single location timeseries. I may be able to include this data in this package.

Indexes

pCo2/Flux Products:
If you haven't already got these working. Here is some more information.

/yasanaka was obtained from Yasanaka. Ask her I cannot provide this.
/co2_gridded_landschuzer

Xarray cannot open some of these files due to:

MissingDimensionsError: 'date' has more than 1-dimension and the same name as one of its dimensions ('time', 'date'). xarray disallows such variables because they conflict with the coordinates used to label dimensions.

Use NCO to convert this variable name so they can be opened. Ie. 
ncrename -v date,t MPI-SOM_FFN_SOCCOMv2018.nc
