1. Dynamic Height:

Dynamic heights are computed from temperature profiles 
by vertically integrating the specific volume anomaly
from the surface to 500 m depth. This produces a dynamic
height at the sea surface referenced to 500 decibars (0/500db).

Details of Dynamic Height Calculation

The specific volume anomaly (steric anomaly) is based on a
1980 equation of state for seawater and 1978 practical 
salinity scale (Millero, et al (1980) Deep-Sea Res., 27a, 255-264
Millero and Poisson 1981, Deep-Sea Res., 28a, pp 625-629).
The salinity data input into the specific volume anomaly calculation
are a set of long-term mean temperature-salinity relations, 
one for each array location, derived from the World Ocean Atlas 
(see Conkright et al 2002: "World Ocean Atlas 2001: Objective Analyses,
Data Statistics, and Figures, CD Rom documentation", National 
Oceanographic Data Center, Silver Spring, MD).

Temperature availability at 500 meters:

Occasionally, temperatures at 500 meters depth are unavailable when
temperatures at 300 meters depth are available. To fill any missing
values in the 0/500db dynamic height series at a given site, we compute 
an orthogonal regression between all of the available 0/300db and 0/500db 
data. The regression coefficients are used to replace missing 0/500db 
values when 0/300db dynamic heights are available. The same method is 
used at all sites, using an independent regression at each site.

2. Time Stamp:

Time associated with data represent the sample time for single sample
values or the middle of the averaging interval for average values.  For
example, daily averages are computed starting at 0000 GMT and are
assigned an observation "time stamp" of 1200 GMT.

3. 5-day, Monthly and Quarterly Averages:

If you delivered 5-day, monthly, or quarterly averaged data
these definitions are relevant to your files:

5-Day: Average of data collected during consecutive five day 
intervals. A minimum of 2 daily values are required to compute 
a 5-day average.

Monthly: Average of all the data collected during each month.
A minimum of 15 daily values are required to compute a monthly 
average.

Quarterly: Average of 3 monthly values. A minimum of 2 monthly 
values are required to compute a quarterly average. 12 quarterly 
averages are computed for each year, one for each center month, 
which includes the previous month, the center month, and the 
next month in the average.

4. Sampling, Sensors, and Moorings:

For detailed information about sampling, sensors, and moorings,
see these web pages:

5. Quality Codes:

In ascii format files organized by site, you will find data 
quality and source codes to the right of the data. In NetCDF 
format files organized by site, you will find quality and 
source variables with the same shape as the data.
These codes are defined below.

Using the quality codes you can tune your analysis to 
trade-off between quality and temporal/spatial coverage.
Quality code definitions are listed below

  0 = datum missing

  1 = highest quality; Pre/post-deployment calibrations agree to within
  sensor specifications.  In most cases only pre-deployment calibrations 
  have been applied

  2 = default quality; Pre-deployment calibrations applied.  Default
  value for sensors presently deployed and for sensors which were either 
  not recovered or not calibratable when recovered.

  3 = adjusted data; Pre/post calibrations differ, or original data do
  not agree with other data sources (e.g., other in situ data or 
  climatology), or original data are noisy. Data have been adjusted in 
  an attempt to reduce the error.

  4 = lower quality; Pre/post calibrations differ, or data do not agree
  with other data sources (e.g., other in situ data or climatology), or 
  data are noisy.  Data could not be confidently adjusted to correct 
  for error.

  5 = sensor or tube failed

6. Source Codes:

  0 - No Sensor, No Data 
  1 - Real Time (Telemetered Mode)
  2 - Derived from Real Time
  3 - Temporally Interpolated from Real Time
  4 - Source Code Inactive at Present
  5 - Recovered from Instrument RAM (Delayed Mode)
  6 - Derived from RAM
  7 - Temporally Interpolated from RAM
